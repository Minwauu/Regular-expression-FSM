## Regular expressions

- Regular expressions are a tool which allows computers to work with text patterns.

- Users include:
  - Validation of input(e.g check the format of an email address)
  - Match patterns in text files (e.g finding a word/phrase in a document)
  - Compilers checking syntax
 
- A regular expressions are often known as a pattern. It is used to specify a set of strings which meet given conditions.

- They use a series of special symbols called *metacharacters*. These are the ones you need to know:

## Finite State Machines (FSM)

- Regular expressions and FSMs are equivalent ways of defining a regular language.

- A language is considered 'regular' if you can represent it by a regular expression.

- Therefore any regular language can also be defined as any language that a Finate State Machine will accept.

## BNF

Regular languages are expressible by regular expressions. Some languages cannot be expressed by a regular expression.

The class of languages called context-free languages is more expressive than regular languages.

BNF is a way to define these context-free languages.

Backus-Naur Form is a formal notation used to describe the syntax rules of a language.

Its a **meta-language**: a language that describes a language.

An instruction for a computer must *not* be ambiguous in any way. 
 - A programming language requires strict and precise rules
 - That is why we have not yet been successful at natural language processing.
 - BNF can be used by compiler writers to represent the precide syntax of a programming language.
