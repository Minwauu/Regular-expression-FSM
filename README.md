## Regular expressions

- Regular expressions are a tool which allows computers to work with text patterns.

- Users include:
  - Validation of input(e.g check the format of an email address)
  - Match patterns in text files (e.g finding a word/phrase in a document)
  - Compilers checking syntax
 
- A regular expressions are often known as a pattern. It is used to specify a set of strings which meet given conditions.

- They use a series of special symbols called *metacharacters*. These are the ones you need to know:

## Finite State Machines (FSM)

- Regular expressions and FSMs are equivalent ways of defining a regular language.

- A language is considered 'regular' if you can represent it by a regular expression.

- Therefore any regular language can also be defined as any language that a Finate State Machine will accept.
